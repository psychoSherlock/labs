### Ithihas:

He calls himself PsychoSherlock — a self-proclaimed genius with an unhealthy obsession for mysteries and computers. After binge-watching crime thrillers and Mr. Robot for years, he decided coding was his ticket to glory. His dream? To infiltrate the legendary halls of MITS, master the art of algorithms, and someday become the CEO of the biggest tech empire in history. Armed with ambition, overconfidence, and a questionable sleep schedule, he’s ready to prove himself. But the question remains… is he truly worthy? He’s convinced his blogs are flawless… which is adorable, because they’re not. Can you find out his mistake?
