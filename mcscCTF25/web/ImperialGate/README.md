Imperial Gate

Long before independence, an Emperor of India concealed a sacred chamber deep within the heart of his fortress. It was said to hold ancient knowledge that could tip the scales in India's favor during the great struggle. After his death, the secrets were lost to time — until now.

Over the years, a mighty wall has risen around it — some call it the Gatekeeper, others the Firewall, the Middleware, or even the Final Barrier. No matter the name, all agree on one thing: it is strong and unbreakable…

...or... is it?

Hint: Oh we just confirmed, its not a Gatekeeper, neither a Firewall, nor a Barrier. Its a Middleware. But rumor has that its not supposed to be used this way. That recently they found a crack in it.
