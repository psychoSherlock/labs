Welcome to Project Azad

🕯️ "Freedom is not given — it is taken."  
 — Chandrashekhar Azad

This application was recovered from the debris of a forgotten hideout destroyed during the final days of British resistance in India.

Among the ashes was a single, scorched device — its storage barely intact. Inside it, this lone application survived, believed to hold the final encrypted oath sworn by Azad’s underground network.

No passwords were found.  
No manual.  
No instructions.

They say only the truly worthy — those who understand the spirit of Azad — can unlock its secret.

Will you?
